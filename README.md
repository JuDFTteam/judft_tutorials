AiiDA-Fleur tutorial
==============

Tutorials will last about 3 hours. We plan to make an introduction into AiiDA and AiiDA-FLEUR data objects, calculations and workchains.

An approximate structure is:

0. Python + Database introduction
1. Data types in AiiDA: Node, Dict, StructureData, Code, Workchain.
2. Data types in AiiDA-FLEUR: FleurinpData as a representation of inp.xml
3. FleurinpDataModifier: a class to modify FleurinpData
4. inpgen code
5. Fleur code
6. SCF, MAE and SSDisp workchains. A small high-throughput study on 3-4 materials.

I think this should be fine for the tutorials. Daniel told me that it is better to have a bit more tasks than can fir into 3 hours.
